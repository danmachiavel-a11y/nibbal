# Discord Resilience Improvements

We've enhanced the application to handle Discord unavailability gracefully. These improvements ensure the system keeps functioning even when Discord is not available, while maintaining full message history for when the connection is restored.

## Current Behavior

When Discord is unavailable (like now):

1. Users can continue using the Telegram bot normally
2. Messages are saved in the database
3. The application logs warnings about Discord unavailability
4. The system continues attempting to reconnect periodically

## Future Improvements

### Main Goal: Graceful Degradation

When Discord is unavailable, the system should:

1. Inform Telegram users with appropriate messages:
   ```
   ⚠️ Discord staff may not see your messages immediately due to connection issues. 
   Your messages are being saved and will be delivered when the connection is restored.
   ```

2. Queue messages for forwarding when Discord becomes available again:
   - Use the existing message queue system
   - Prioritize important notifications and status updates
   - Include timestamp information for delayed messages

3. Add health monitoring endpoints:
   - `/api/health` endpoint showing service status
   - Detailed component health reporting
   - Alert mechanisms for extended Discord outages

### Implementation Notes

1. We've added an `isDiscordAvailable` flag to the BridgeManager
2. Messages are still stored in the database even when Discord is unavailable
3. The application will periodically attempt to reconnect to Discord in the background
4. The system is robust enough to handle Discord connectivity issues without crashing

## Testing Fallback Functionality 

To test the system's resilience:

1. Keep using the application normally through Telegram
2. Check that all messages appear in the database, even when Discord is unavailable
3. Once a valid token is provided, verify that messages are properly forwarded

## Next Steps

1. Wait for the new Discord token to be provided
2. Apply the token and verify Discord connectivity
3. Consider additional robustness improvements if needed
