# WebSocket Crash Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Your bot was experiencing **WebSocket handshake timeouts** with Discord, causing the entire process to crash with the error:
```
Error: Opening handshake has timed out
    at ClientRequest.<anonymous> (node_modules\ws\lib\websocket.js:873:7)
```

## Root Causes
1. **Uncaught WebSocket errors** - WebSocket handshake timeouts were not being caught by Discord.js error handlers
2. **Aggressive restart behavior** - The recovery system was restarting the entire process for WebSocket issues
3. **Missing error handling** - No specific handling for WebSocket connection failures at the Discord client level

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Discord Client Error Handling
**File: `server/bot/discord.ts`**
- Added comprehensive error handler for Discord client
- Specific handling for WebSocket/handshake timeout errors
- Prevents WebSocket errors from crashing the process
- Implements automatic recovery with 10-second delay

### 2. Improved Recovery System
**File: `server/recovery.ts`**
- Added specific handling for WebSocket connection errors
- Implemented gentle recovery for WebSocket timeouts (no immediate restart)
- Enhanced error categorization for better diagnostics
- Allows up to 5 WebSocket errors per hour before considering restart

### 3. Enhanced Reconnection Logic
**File: `server/bot/discord.ts`**
- Improved `reconnect()` method with better error handling
- Added connection state tracking
- Implemented delayed recovery for handshake failures
- Better error logging and diagnostics

## Key Improvements

### Error Handling
```typescript
client.on('error', (error) => {
  // Check if this is a handshake timeout error
  if (error.message.includes('handshake') || error.message.includes('timeout') || error.message.includes('WebSocket')) {
    log(`WebSocket connection error detected - attempting recovery without crash`, "warn");
    
    // Don't let this crash the process - attempt recovery instead
    this.isConnected = false;
    
    // Schedule a reconnection attempt with delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.reconnect().catch(e => {
        log(`Recovery reconnection failed: ${e}`, "error");
      });
    }, 10000); // 10 second delay
    
    return; // Prevent the error from propagating
  }
});
```

### Recovery Strategy
- WebSocket timeouts trigger gentle recovery (no immediate restart)
- Only restart after multiple failures or other critical errors
- Enhanced monitoring and health checks
- Improved connection state tracking

## Expected Results

1. **No More Crashes**: WebSocket handshake timeouts will no longer crash the bot
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Bot will automatically recover from connection issues
3. **Better Stability**: Improved error handling prevents process crashes
4. **Improved Logging**: Better diagnostics for connection issues

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages to confirm the fixes are working:
- `"WebSocket connection error detected - attempting recovery without crash"`
- `"Discord bot reconnection successful"`
- `"WebSocket error - allowing bot recovery mechanisms to handle reconnection"`

## Testing

The bot should now:
1. Handle WebSocket handshake timeouts gracefully
2. Recover from connection issues without crashing
3. Maintain stability during network problems
4. Provide better error reporting for debugging

## Important Note

The fixes focus on **error handling and recovery** rather than trying to prevent the WebSocket timeouts themselves. Discord.js doesn't expose low-level WebSocket configuration options, so the approach is to catch these errors and handle them gracefully rather than crash the entire process.

Your bot should now be much more resilient to WebSocket connection issues.
