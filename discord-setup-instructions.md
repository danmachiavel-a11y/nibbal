# Discord Bot Setup Instructions

The Discord bot is experiencing authentication issues. Here are instructions to create a new Discord bot and get a valid token:

## Step 1: Create a New Discord Application

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click the "New Application" button
3. Name your application (e.g., "Fat Eats Bot")
4. Accept the terms and click "Create"

## Step 2: Create a Bot User

1. In your new application, click on the "Bot" tab in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add Bot" and confirm the action
3. Under the "TOKEN" section, click "Reset Token" and confirm
4. Copy the newly generated token - it should look something like:
   `MTA4NzM5MjAzMDk3OTAxMDU2MA.AbCdEf.1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

## Step 3: Set Required Bot Permissions

1. Still on the "Bot" tab, scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents"
2. Enable the following intents:
   - MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
   - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
   - PRESENCE INTENT
3. Save changes

## Step 4: Add Bot to Your Server

1. Click on "OAuth2" in the left sidebar, then "URL Generator"
2. Under "SCOPES", select "bot"
3. Under "BOT PERMISSIONS", select:
   - Administrator (for simplicity, or select specific permissions below)
   - Manage Channels
   - Manage Roles
   - Read Messages/View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Manage Messages
   - Attach Files
   - Read Message History
   - Mention Everyone
4. Copy the generated URL at the bottom
5. Paste the URL in a browser, select your server, and authorize the bot

## Step 5: Update Bot Token in the Application

1. In the `.env` file, replace `REPLACE_WITH_VALID_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your new token
2. Restart the application

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Make sure the bot has been added to your server
2. Check that you've enabled the required intents
3. Verify the token is correct and hasn't expired
4. Try creating a completely new application and bot

The Telegram bot should continue to function normally while the Discord bot is being reconfigured.
